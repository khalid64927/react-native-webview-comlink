# react-native-webview-comlink [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rocwind/react-native-webview-comlink.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rocwind/react-native-webview-comlink)

## Install
* Install the package `npm i --save react-native-webview-comlink`
* Eject expo project: if React Native project is created by `expo-cli`, it needs to be ejected by `npm run eject`
* For Android: Since comlink needs ES6 features to work, it is recommended to use up-to-date JavaScriptCore for Android build, check out [JSC build scripts](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts) for more details about how to integrate jsc to React Native project
